## What Gossiper Does

Students join lecture sessions and get live captions in their language. They pay ₦50 to help fund the session.

### Problems We Solve

- International students can't understand lectures in foreign languages
- Deaf and hard-of-hearing students need real-time captions
- Accessibility tools cost too much for students
- Current solutions don't work together

### How It Works

**Connect wallet → Join session → Get captions → Pay ₦50**

- **Connect Wallet**: Use Phantom or Solflare - no signup needed
- **Join Session**: Enter code from your lecturer
- **Get Captions**: See live text in your language (50+ languages supported)
- **Pay ₦50**: Help fund the session for everyone
- **Accessible**: Works with screen readers and high contrast mode

## Try It Out

1. Connect your Solana wallet
2. Enter the session code your lecturer shared
3. Pick your language
4. See captions appear as the lecturer speaks
5. Pay ₦50 to help fund the session
